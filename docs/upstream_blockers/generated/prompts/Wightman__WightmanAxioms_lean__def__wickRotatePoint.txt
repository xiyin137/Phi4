/-- The Wightman functions have analytic continuation to the forward tube.

    The n-point Wightman function W_n(x₁,...,xₙ), initially defined as a
    distribution on real spacetime points, extends to a holomorphic function
    on the forward tube T_n.

    By Lorentz covariance, it further extends to the extended forward tube T_n^{ext}.
    The edge-of-the-wedge theorem (Bargmann-Hall-Wightman) shows this extension
    is single-valued.

    We define `analyticContinuation` on the full ambient space ℂ^{n(d+1)} and
    constrain holomorphicity to the forward tube via `DifferentiableOn`. -/

/-- **Spectrum condition implies Fourier-Laplace distributional boundary values.**

    If a Wightman QFT has an analytic continuation to the forward tube (holomorphic
    on ForwardTube d n), and the QFT satisfies the spectrum condition, then the analytic
    continuation has tempered distributional boundary values.

    The boundary value distribution T is determined by the Wightman n-point function:
    the spectrum condition constrains the Fourier transform of W_n to be supported in
    the dual cone V_+^*, which is exactly the condition for W_n to be the distributional
    boundary value of its Fourier-Laplace transform (the analytic continuation).

    This is the fundamental connection between:
    (a) The Wightman distribution W_n (tempered, defined via inner products)
    (b) The analytic continuation (holomorphic on the forward tube)
    (c) The Fourier-Laplace representation (connecting (a) and (b))

What already failed:
1) <ATTEMPT_1 + error/result>
2) <ATTEMPT_2 + error/result>

Constraints:
- No axioms/placeholders/weakened theorem statements.
- Keep existing architecture and imports unless necessary.
- Prefer reusable infrastructure lemmas over brittle one-off hacks.

Request:
1) Propose 2-3 concrete solution paths, ranked by feasibility.
2) For the top path, give exact code-level steps.
3) Point out likely type mismatches or missing bridge lemmas.
4) If statement looks false/underdetermined, provide a minimal counterexample strategy or corrected intermediate lemma.
5) Keep output actionable and concise.
