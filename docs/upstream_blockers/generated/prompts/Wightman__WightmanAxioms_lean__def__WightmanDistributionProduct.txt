/-- **Schwartz nuclear theorem (kernel theorem for Schwartz spaces).**

    Given a separately continuous multilinear functional Phi on n copies of
    S(R^{d+1}), there exists a unique continuous linear functional W on the
    full Schwartz space S(R^{n(d+1)}) such that W agrees with Phi on product
    test functions: W(f_1 tensor ... tensor f_n) = Phi(f_1,...,f_n).

    The nuclear theorem guarantees that the multilinear Wightman n-point function
    extends to a continuous linear functional on the full Schwartz space S(R^{n(d+1)}).

    Since S(R^{d+1}) is nuclear (proved in SchwartzNuclear.lean),
    the completed projective tensor product S(R^{d+1}) tensor_pi ... tensor_pi S(R^{d+1})
    is isomorphic (as a topological vector space) to S(R^{n(d+1)}).

    The proof requires:
    1. Schwartz space is nuclear (proved in SchwartzNuclear.lean)
    2. For nuclear spaces, the projective tensor product topology agrees with
       the injective tensor product topology
    3. S(R^{d+1}) tensor_pi ... tensor_pi S(R^{d+1}) = S(R^{n(d+1)}) as TVS
    4. Separately continuous multilinear functionals on nuclear spaces extend
       uniquely to continuous functionals on the completed tensor product

What already failed:
1) <ATTEMPT_1 + error/result>
2) <ATTEMPT_2 + error/result>

Constraints:
- No axioms/placeholders/weakened theorem statements.
- Keep existing architecture and imports unless necessary.
- Prefer reusable infrastructure lemmas over brittle one-off hacks.

Request:
1) Propose 2-3 concrete solution paths, ranked by feasibility.
2) For the top path, give exact code-level steps.
3) Point out likely type mismatches or missing bridge lemmas.
4) If statement looks false/underdetermined, provide a minimal counterexample strategy or corrected intermediate lemma.
5) Keep output actionable and concise.
