You are assisting with a focused coding/proof blocker.

Task:
- Primary goal: Close upstream blocker theorem:full_analytic_continuation without placeholders.
- Current blocker: Declaration currently contains 'sorry' (score=202, status=open, sorry_count=2, reverse_importers=1).

Repository context:
- Language/toolchain: Lean 4 + Mathlib
- File(s): /Users/xiyin/Phi4/.lake/packages/OSReconstruction/OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightman.lean
- Target declaration: theorem full_analytic_continuation

Current local context:
- Relevant hypotheses/locals:

a) Declaration snippet (from Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightman.lean:206)
theorem full_analytic_continuation
    (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (k : ℕ) :
    ∃ (W_analytic : (Fin k → Fin (d + 1) → ℂ) → ℂ),
      DifferentiableOn ℂ W_analytic (ForwardTube d k) ∧
      (∀ (f : SchwartzNPoint d k),
        OS.S k f = ∫ x : NPointDomain d k,
          W_analytic (fun j => wickRotatePoint (x j)) * (f x)) := by

b) Build target
- lake build OSReconstruction.Wightman.Reconstruction.WickRotation.OSToWightman

What already failed:
1) <ATTEMPT_1 + error/result>
2) <ATTEMPT_2 + error/result>

Constraints:
- No axioms/placeholders/weakened theorem statements.
- Keep existing architecture and imports unless necessary.
- Prefer reusable infrastructure lemmas over brittle one-off hacks.

Request:
1) Propose 2-3 concrete solution paths, ranked by feasibility.
2) For the top path, give exact code-level steps.
3) Point out likely type mismatches or missing bridge lemmas.
4) If statement looks false/underdetermined, provide a minimal counterexample strategy or corrected intermediate lemma.
5) Keep output actionable and concise.
