You are assisting with a focused coding/proof blocker.

Task:
- Primary goal: Close upstream blocker theorem:Fin.Perm.adjSwap_induction_right without placeholders.
- Current blocker: Declaration currently contains 'sorry' (score=220, status=open, sorry_count=2, reverse_importers=4).

Repository context:
- Language/toolchain: Lean 4 + Mathlib
- File(s): /Users/xiyin/Phi4/.lake/packages/OSReconstruction/OSReconstruction/ComplexLieGroups/Connectedness.lean
- Target declaration: theorem Fin.Perm.adjSwap_induction_right

Current local context:
- Relevant hypotheses/locals:

a) Declaration snippet (from ComplexLieGroups/Connectedness.lean:1992)
theorem Fin.Perm.adjSwap_induction_right {n : ℕ}
    {motive : Equiv.Perm (Fin n) → Prop}
    (one : motive 1)
    (mul_adj : ∀ (σ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) (i : Fin n) (hi : i.val + 1 < n),
      motive σ → motive (σ * Equiv.swap i ⟨i.val + 1, hi⟩))
    (τ : Equiv.Perm (Fin n)) : motive τ := by

b) Build target
- lake build OSReconstruction.ComplexLieGroups.Connectedness

What already failed:
1) <ATTEMPT_1 + error/result>
2) <ATTEMPT_2 + error/result>

Constraints:
- No axioms/placeholders/weakened theorem statements.
- Keep existing architecture and imports unless necessary.
- Prefer reusable infrastructure lemmas over brittle one-off hacks.

Request:
1) Propose 2-3 concrete solution paths, ranked by feasibility.
2) For the top path, give exact code-level steps.
3) Point out likely type mismatches or missing bridge lemmas.
4) If statement looks false/underdetermined, provide a minimal counterexample strategy or corrected intermediate lemma.
5) Keep output actionable and concise.
