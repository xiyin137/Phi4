You are assisting with a focused coding/proof blocker.

Task:
- Primary goal: Close upstream blocker theorem:schwartz_nuclear_extension without placeholders.
- Current blocker: Declaration currently contains 'sorry' (score=294, status=open, sorry_count=1, reverse_importers=5).

Repository context:
- Language/toolchain: Lean 4 + Mathlib
- File(s): /Users/xiyin/Phi4/.lake/packages/OSReconstruction/OSReconstruction/Wightman/WightmanAxioms.lean
- Target declaration: theorem schwartz_nuclear_extension

Current local context:
- Relevant hypotheses/locals:

a) Declaration snippet (from Wightman/WightmanAxioms.lean:296)
private theorem schwartz_nuclear_extension (d n : ℕ) [NeZero d]
    (Phi : (Fin n → SchwartzSpacetime d) → ℂ)
    (hPhi_sep : ∀ (i : Fin n) (fs : Fin n → SchwartzSpacetime d),
      Continuous (fun f => Phi (Function.update fs i f))) :
    ∃ (W : SchwartzNPointSpace d n →L[ℂ] ℂ),
      ∀ fs : Fin n → SchwartzSpacetime d,
        W (SchwartzMap.productTensor fs) = Phi fs := by

b) Build target
- lake build OSReconstruction.Wightman.WightmanAxioms

What already failed:
1) <ATTEMPT_1 + error/result>
2) <ATTEMPT_2 + error/result>

Constraints:
- No axioms/placeholders/weakened theorem statements.
- Keep existing architecture and imports unless necessary.
- Prefer reusable infrastructure lemmas over brittle one-off hacks.

Request:
1) Propose 2-3 concrete solution paths, ranked by feasibility.
2) For the top path, give exact code-level steps.
3) Point out likely type mismatches or missing bridge lemmas.
4) If statement looks false/underdetermined, provide a minimal counterexample strategy or corrected intermediate lemma.
5) Keep output actionable and concise.
