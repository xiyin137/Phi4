You are assisting with a focused coding/proof blocker.

Task:
- Primary goal: Close upstream blocker theorem:spectrum_implies_distributional_bv without placeholders.
- Current blocker: Declaration currently contains 'sorry' (score=294, status=open, sorry_count=1, reverse_importers=5).

Repository context:
- Language/toolchain: Lean 4 + Mathlib
- File(s): /Users/xiyin/Phi4/.lake/packages/OSReconstruction/OSReconstruction/Wightman/WightmanAxioms.lean
- Target declaration: theorem spectrum_implies_distributional_bv

Current local context:
- Relevant hypotheses/locals:

a) Declaration snippet (from Wightman/WightmanAxioms.lean:476)
private theorem spectrum_implies_distributional_bv {d n : ℕ} [NeZero d]
    {F : (Fin n → Fin (d + 1) → ℂ) → ℂ}
    (hF : DifferentiableOn ℂ F (ForwardTube d n))
    (T : SchwartzNPointSpace d n → ℂ)
    (hT_cont : Continuous T) :
    ∀ (f : SchwartzNPointSpace d n) (η : Fin n → Fin (d + 1) → ℝ),
      InForwardCone d n η →
      Filter.Tendsto
        (fun ε : ℝ => ∫ x : NPointSpacetime d n,
          F (fun k μ => ↑(x k μ) + ε * ↑(η k μ) * Complex.I) * (f x))
        (nhdsWithin 0 (Set.Ioi 0))
        (nhds (T f)) := by

What already failed:
1) <ATTEMPT_1 + error/result>
2) <ATTEMPT_2 + error/result>

Constraints:
- No axioms/placeholders/weakened theorem statements.
- Keep existing architecture and imports unless necessary.
- Prefer reusable infrastructure lemmas over brittle one-off hacks.

Request:
1) Propose 2-3 concrete solution paths, ranked by feasibility.
2) For the top path, give exact code-level steps.
3) Point out likely type mismatches or missing bridge lemmas.
4) If statement looks false/underdetermined, provide a minimal counterexample strategy or corrected intermediate lemma.
5) Keep output actionable and concise.
