You are assisting with a focused coding/proof blocker.

Task:
- Primary goal: Close upstream blocker theorem:bv_positive_definiteness_transfer without placeholders.
- Current blocker: Declaration currently contains 'sorry' (score=199, status=open, sorry_count=1, reverse_importers=1).

Repository context:
- Language/toolchain: Lean 4 + Mathlib
- File(s): /Users/xiyin/Phi4/.lake/packages/OSReconstruction/OSReconstruction/Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightman.lean
- Target declaration: theorem bv_positive_definiteness_transfer

Current local context:
- Relevant hypotheses/locals:

a) Declaration snippet (from Wightman/Reconstruction/WickRotation/OSToWightman.lean:509)
theorem bv_positive_definiteness_transfer (OS : OsterwalderSchraderAxioms d)
    (lgc : OSLinearGrowthCondition d OS)
    (W : (n : ℕ) → SchwartzNPoint d n → ℂ)
    (hW_eq : ∀ n, W n = bvt_W OS lgc n)
    (hE2 : ∀ (F : BorchersSequence d),
      (∀ n, ∀ x : NPointDomain d n, (F.funcs n).toFun x ≠ 0 →
        x ∈ PositiveTimeRegion d n) →
      (OSInnerProduct d OS.S F F).re ≥ 0) :
    ∀ F : BorchersSequence d, (WightmanInnerProduct d W F F).re ≥ 0 := by

What already failed:
1) <ATTEMPT_1 + error/result>
2) <ATTEMPT_2 + error/result>

Constraints:
- No axioms/placeholders/weakened theorem statements.
- Keep existing architecture and imports unless necessary.
- Prefer reusable infrastructure lemmas over brittle one-off hacks.

Request:
1) Propose 2-3 concrete solution paths, ranked by feasibility.
2) For the top path, give exact code-level steps.
3) Point out likely type mismatches or missing bridge lemmas.
4) If statement looks false/underdetermined, provide a minimal counterexample strategy or corrected intermediate lemma.
5) Keep output actionable and concise.
